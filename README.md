# the-python-workshop

A workshop to learn Python best practices.

The workshop promotes both the knowledge of python concepts and skills, as well as good practices (including testing). 
For best results, code should be developed and tested incrementally. 

The workshop is structured as a series of *code katas* (see "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata_(programming)")

> Please note that workshop is not intended to teach/cover python basics and having a basic python understanding is a pre-requisite.

Instructions
====

- Engage in some planning to achieve the goal. This may yield a number of stories, similar to [these](doc/stories.md)
- Each story is achieved through a kata. Work through the katas sequentially. While each kata stands on its own, later katas build upon earlier ones.
- Instructions for each kata are documented independently, beginning with [kata 1](doc/kata-1/HOW-TO.md) 

Cleaning up afterwards!
====

- At any point, you can delete the resources provisioned and avoid incurring costs by deleting the resources stacks created. (resources may come in later katas)

Pre-requisites
====

- an account on Github
- git version control client
- AWS account
- AWS CLI installed and configured with credentials privileged to operate upon:
- An IDE (Pycharm, VSCode etc)
- Python 3 installed.
- Basic Python knowledge. This course on [RELX Udemy](https://relxlearning.udemy.com/course/python-for-absolute-beginners-u/)

Organisation
====

- Code and notes for each kata are in a folder in [`doc`](doc) named after the kata (say, [kata-1](doc/kata-1))
- Instructions for each kata are in the HOW-TO.md document (say, [HOW-TO](doc/kata-1/HOW-TO.md))
- For each kata, code is provided. You may refer to it at the conclusion of the kata.
